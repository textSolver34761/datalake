Initally, the architecture was supposed to look like the following : <br />

<br /> However, we could use Docker (docker-compose) to produce the data but not to consume it. <br />

The group decided to slit the work : <br /> Alima and Fatima continue the project (https://github.com/Fatima-Oraich/SparkStreaming), <br /> while I tried and experiement the Azure API : https://github.com/textSolver34761/azure and https://github.com/textSolver34761/azure-api-front-Angular
